Hey, thanks for checking out this purrrfect app here's some info:

Node: v14.17.0

Start the app: 
- yarn run initial-startup
- yarn start (*if it prompts you to clear the project files and reinitialize them, select No*)
- once metro finishes booting, press i for iOS, w for Web, and a for Android


What does it do: 
- Loads 10 cat images from the CATAAS (Cats as a service) API

Things that I'll be working on: 
- Better loading (allow chunks to be loaded instead of just a few images)
- different modes: 
    - Random cat mode: loads a cat image, then on btn press changes the image for another one
    - Meme Maker: The api would make this super easy, basically there would be a screen with a textInput and btn. When user types something and hits the btn it loads a cat meme (see /assets/err.jpg for an example)
    - filter options: filter out different types of cats by tag
